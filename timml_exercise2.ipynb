    "## Exercise 2: A system with wells, rivers, and recharge\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a system of three aquifers. The aquifer parameters are presented in Table 1; note that an average thickness is specified for the top unconfined aquifer. A river with three branches cuts through the upper aquifer. The river is modeled with 7 head-specified line-sinks and each branch is modeled with 5 line-sinks. The Northern branch is modeled with resistance line-sinks with a resistance $c$ of 5 days and a width $w$ of 10 meters. The heads are specified at the centers of the line-sinks and are shown in Figure 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Three wells are present. Well 1 is screened in aquifer 0 and has a discharge of 1000 m$^3$/d, well 2 is screened in aquifer 2 and has a discharge of 5000 m$^3$/d, and well 3 is screened in aquifers 1 and 2 and has a total discharge of 5000 m$^3$/d. A constant recharge through the upper boundary of aquifer 0 is simulated by one large circular infiltration area that covers the entire model area; the recharge rate is 0.2 mm/day. A head of 175 m is specified in layer 0 at the upper righthand corner of the model domain. A layout of all analytic elements, except the boundary of the infiltration area, is shown in Figure 1. \n",
