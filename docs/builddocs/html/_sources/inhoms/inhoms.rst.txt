Inhomogeneities
---------------

Polygonal inhomogeneities can be added in three ways:

1. :class:`~timml.inhomogeneity.PolygonInhomMaq`, which is an inhomogeneity
consisting of a regular sequence of aquifer - leaky layer - aquifer - leaky layer, aquifer, etc.
The top of the system can be either an aquifer or a leaky layer. 

2. Model3D to be added
